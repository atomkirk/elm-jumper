Back in 2010-2014, I worked full time on an calendar iOS app for the App Store, so I've done a metric crap-ton of date calculations.
This API is my distillation of every operation I did on dates and times for that application. And now I'm bringing it to Elm. I really
think these simple functions, composed, will let you do any datetime transformation/calculation you'd ever need.
